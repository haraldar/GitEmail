GitEmail
---

Library/ module in JavaScript and Python for extracting (and soon analyzing) user profile information using the public GitHub API.

The Chrome browser extension features:
  - getting the public email of GitHub users by username or ID.
  - injects a Gists button that navigates to the gists page of the user in question.
  - [in progress] collects, analyzes and produces a report of a user profile.

(Basically a pun. "GitEmail" = "Get Email", but with "Git". Do you git it? I mean get it.)
