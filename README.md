GitEmail
---

A Chrome extension for enhancing the GitHub UI.

Features:
  - getting the public email of GitHub users by username or ID.
  - a Gists button that navigates to the gists page of the displayed users' page.
  - [soon] an Invitations button that easily allows to enter a company/ GH user and a repo.
  - [maybe] download code button anywhere in the folder structure.
  
Includes the main library in JS and Python for possible separate usage.

(Basically a pun. "GitEmail" = "Get Email", but with "Git". Do you git it? I mean get it.)
